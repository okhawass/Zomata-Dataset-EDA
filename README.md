# Zomata-Dataset-EDA

The Dataset: a collection of restaurants that are registered on Zomato in Bengaluru City. There are more than 50000 rows and 17 columns, a fairly large dataset. 

Data Analysis: After cleaning the data and handling all missing values, we take a look at certain features in the data and visualize them in a pie chart, as well as explore how ratings are affected by these features. The top 10 locations with the highest number of restaurants, locations based on ratings, and most common restaurant types are displayed using bar plots. We also analyze and display the 10 most expensive locations and evaluate the correlation between cost and ratings. 

Use Cases: This information could be highly beneficial for individuals looking to open/purchase a restaurant in Bengaluru City. It gives them insights on which cities have the most competition, which restaurant types are more common etc. This could result in new businesses obtaining a competitive advantage over others and will result in accurate, data driven decisions being made.
